# My Personal Website

Besides providing a means of deploying my very own personal website to the internet, this project was also a way to learn more about front-end/web-hosting technologies (so far, no backend needed). 
I used a template provided by [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) and added my own twists here and there to make it better suit my tastes. 
I also felt like decided to keep it simple by using pure HTML + CSS + Javascript (well, there was some Bootstrap and jQuery thrown in there, too) to get a better handle on these "low-level" front-end technologies (as opposed to
more advanced libraries and/or frameworks). Big thanks to Github for the free web hosting!
